Our system is designed as part of our academic studies. 
We build a system that allows players to reserve a sports field or to schedule training with a professional trainer.
The system also allows users to purchase necessary products to play.
We used a few integrations with our system: First is Open street maps API, to show the locations of every field.
The second is Google Calendar API, which allows players to add the train or their game to their calendar.
Lastly, is PayPal API, which allows users to pay for their purchases in the shop.
